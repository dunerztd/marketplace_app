## Problem
Finding a guitar teacher can be difficult when starting out or for when you have a particular style/skill in mind. As we are currently in isolation due to COVID-19, many people are fulfilling a long held wish to learn a musical instrument and are reaching for a guitar.
This marketplace app will give you the ability to find a guitar teacher based on a particular style you want to play with teachers listed by their specialty. As we are unable to be in close contact, the app will give students the ability to purchase lessons blocks and set up lessons over a webcam. This has the advantage of location not being a problem plus opening up the potential to find students/teachers anywhere in the globe.

(Complete discussion of the projectâ€™s models with an understanding of how its active record associations function)


User:
- has_one Teacher, a Teacher belongs_to a User
- has_many Bookings, a Booking belongs_to a User

In addition to these associations, a User can have one Teacher who can have many Styles, many Bookings and one Image.
Through Users association with Booking, Users can have many Bookings who can have a Teacher who has many Styles and one Image.

Teacher:
- belongs_to User, a User has_one Teacher
- has_many Bookings, a Booking belongs_to a Teacher

## Planning

- using trello
- came up with 2 main ideas for the app. went with guitar lesson app.
- sketching out thoughts/ideas to start
- tested a few ideas out first to see if they were possible. Figured out how to apply a javascript drop down menu with Bootstrap pretty quickly. Did a lot of research in scheduling/appointments. Looked at gems and videos on how to do this. Came up with an OK solution of how to accomplish it.
- creating rough idea of how a guest/student/teacher would navigate through the app (user stories to help with this)
- created wireframes then ERD.
- decided against scheduling/appointments as this seen as an extra function and the user can just buy lesson 'blocks'. The actual lesson time can be figured out between the student and teacher.
- - Minimum Viable Product with minimal front-end as coding aim. If time permits add extra functionality and/or improve front-end.
- Finish all documentation (as much as possible) before start coding.
- have roughly 2 weeks to complete the coding.

- in trello
- first listed all mandatory tasks as per assignment outline (requirements/rubric)
- focused on finishing all the documentation tasks first.
- Will add all coding tasks once documentation tasks completed.
